#Quick Start

This page aims to show a rough and ready approach to checking the library is installed and working.

All the following examples require that you run the following setup:

```
pip3 install EllucianEthosPythonClient
```

## Check library version

Run a python3 console and type the following:

```
import EllucianEthosPythonClient
print(EllucianEthosPythonClient.__version__)
```
This should output the version of the library that is installed. (If this dosen't work check you ran the pip install command)

## Login to Ethos and call an API to fetch a resourse
